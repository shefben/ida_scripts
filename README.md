# IDA Resource Tools

This repository contains two complementary IDA Pro 9.2 scripts for working with the `.rsrc` section of Windows PE binaries.  
Together, they allow both **formatting and visualization** of Windows resources directly inside IDA.

> Can be run as either a Python script within IDA or as a plugin.

## üß† Scripts Overview

### `format_rsrc.py`
An **IDA in-database formatter** that dissects and annotates the `.rsrc` section in PE files.  
It identifies resource directories, names, and data entries, applying type-aware parsing for common resource types such as dialogs, menus, icons, cursors, and version information.

**Key features**
- Walks the `.rsrc` tree recursively and adds structure names and comments.  
- Recognizes standard resource types (`DIALOG`, `MENU`, `STRING`, `VERSION`, `ICON`, etc.).  
- Creates IDA string literals, defines words/dwords, and sets readable labels for each entry.  
- Annotates version info blocks, dialog templates, and accelerator tables.  
- Requires no external dependencies‚Äîruns entirely inside IDA using its native modules (`ida_bytes`, `ida_segment`, `ida_kernwin`, etc.).

---

### `resource_viewer.py`
A **PySide6-based resource browser and previewer**.  
It scans the parsed `.rsrc` section and displays a navigable tree of resource entries, allowing interactive previews of embedded icons, cursors, bitmaps, dialogs, and menus.

**Key features**
- PySide6 GUI for interactive viewing.  
- Previews icons and cursors (legacy monochrome and PNG/DIB formats).  
- Displays dialogs and menus using live Win32 previews.  
- Decodes version info, accelerators, and string tables.  
- Integrates with IDA logging and runs as script or plugin (`run()` entry point).  
- Depends on `PySide6` and optionally `Pillow` for image handling.

---

### `gui_annotation.py`
An **IDA 9.2 plugin and script** that automatically scans Windows GUI binaries and annotates assembly and pseudocode with context-aware comments for dialogs, controls, and message-handling routines.  
It bridges `.rsrc` parsing with code analysis to reveal how GUI components connect to functions and message maps.

**Key features**
- Automatically locates and indexes controls, menus, and dialog resources from `.rsrc`.  
- Adds comments for `WM_*` messages, `IDS_*` strings, and GUI-related API calls (`CreateDialogParam`, `SendMessage`, etc.).  
- Identifies MFC and ATL message handlers (`OnCommand`, `OnNotify`, etc.) and annotates their references.  
- Supports both x86 and x64 binaries and uses backtracking to resolve register and stack-based arguments.  
- Integrates with Hex-Rays to show GUI comments inline in pseudocode when available.  
- Can be run as an **IDA plugin** or a **stand-alone script**, requiring no external dependencies.  
- Designed for performance and readability, enhancing disassembly clarity when reverse engineering GUI-heavy Windows binaries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Requirements**

Each script includes its own `requirements.txt`  
- `format_rsrc.py` ‚Üí no external dependencies  
- `resource_viewer.py` ‚Üí requires `PySide6` and `Pillow`

Install them with IDA‚Äôs bundled Python:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

**Plugin setup (optional)**  
1. Place the scripts in IDA‚Äôs `plugins/` directory.  
2. Restart IDA‚Äîthe plugin appears in the Plugins menu.

---

## üß© Example Workflow
1. Run `format_rsrc.py` in IDA to annotate the `.rsrc` tree.  
2. Launch `resource_viewer.py` to browse and preview icons, dialogs, and other resource items.

## üìÑ License
Use freely at your own risk. These scripts interact directly with PE resource structures inside IDA; quirks with malformed binaries or odd encodings are your problem.
